# Neovim Configuration

My attempt to create my own neovim configuration with just enough features to be productive and not too many to be bloated.

## Features

- file tree with nvim-tree
- lsp management with mason-nvim
- telescope for searching/grepping
- theming with themery
- tabfluline
- terminal with f-term
- harpoon for deving on subsets of files
- extended history
- auto-pairs
- debugger with nvim-dap and dapui

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.
2. Run `:Lazy` to install all plugins.
